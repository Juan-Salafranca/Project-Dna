# Project-Dna

Introduction
This project was made in the context of the CH-200 Practical Programming for chemistry course at EPFL by two second year Bachelor students in Chemistry and Chemical engineering. 

Overview
The Protein Analysis Package is a Python package designed to perform various analyses on ADN and their respective protein sequences. The package includes functions to convert ADN sequences into protein sequences by evaluating all possible frames of ADN. It is also able to analyse the protein sequences and calculate the hydrophobicity score, molecular weight, likelihood of secondary structure configurations (beta-sheet, alpha-helix, and beta-turn), and the retention coefficient in High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) based on provided amino acid sequences.
